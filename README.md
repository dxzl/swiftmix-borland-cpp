# swiftmix-borland-cpp
SwiftMiX is a DJ-like music-mixer that uses Windows-Media Player Active-X components. It can import/export/convert most playlists and handles Unicode file-paths.

This project builds with Borland C++ Builder 4. If you don't use Borland/Embarcadero Delphi or
C++ it may be a waste of time to download this repository.

I included the libraries in aaa_lib.zip and the pre-built binary for Windows in aaa_exe.zip. There is also a
Readme.txt file.
